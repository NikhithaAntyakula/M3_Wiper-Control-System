# REQUIREMENTS
## Introduction
* The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction. The system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.
## Research
* The system uses a combination of impedance and rain sensor to detect rain and its intensity. The system contains a controller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals The aim of this project is to help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is switching on and off the wiper. In rainy days we suffer from the act of sprinkling of water on the front glass of our wheeler. While driving, when drivers cannot see visibly on-road vehicles they try operating the wiper on glass manually, at times switching on and off intermittently and this distraction might cause vehicle accident. If we apply any kind of sensor on glass which senses the act of sprinkling water, by automation, the wiper will be operating automatically. When the water hit the sensor, it will send a signal to the system thus triggering the wiper motor. Once the sensor does not detect any water, the wiper will stop.
## ADVANTAGES
* It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
* It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.
## DISADVANTAGES
* Smart Wiper Control System uses infrared sensor which is implemented in the latest cars but it has few disadvantages. The One is space occupied on the screen is small and the second (main) drawback is need of clear wiping on the windscreen, where the sensor is placed.

### WHAT

* A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.

### WHERE

* The present invention relates generally to a wiper control system for an automotive windshield wiper, which automatically controls the operating speed of the wiper in dependence upon rain conditions.

### WHY

* Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.

### WHEN

* If the humidity level or the rain, dew deposited on the windshield is more, than accordingly wiper will move. In that case, the system will turn on the wiper motor to activate at high speed using the driver circuit. If the level of humidity is low, then the wiper motor is activated at low speed.

### HOW

* Virtually all automotive wipers are controlled by a microprocessor. Many wiper systems in cars today use a rain sensor to detect the speed at which the raindrops are falling on the windshield. A microprocessor evaluates the signals from the sensor to calculate the speed at which the wipers should move.
